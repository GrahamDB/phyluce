Citing PHYLUCE
==============

You can cite the `phyluce`_ repository using:

    Faircloth BC. 2013. phyluce: phylogenetics inference from ultraconserved
    elements.  doi:`10.6079/J9PHYL <http://doi.org/10.6079/J9PHYL>`_.


Please also cite the following manuscript, which describes the first use of the
computer code as well as the general approach.  We should soon have an
additional manuscript for the software, alone.
