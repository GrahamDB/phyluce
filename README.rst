Note
----

Users, of this code should be aware that we will or already have split
portions of the code within this repository into separate repositories 
and/or packages for official distribution.  Similarly, parts of the code
within may already be part of existing, official repositories - we have
put everything together here to provide a cohesive whole.

We will make an attempt to list those repositories below:
